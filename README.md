### Hand-ins and grading

There are two programming projects you will "hand in" as GitHub repositories: the CodeCamp project and
the final project. Both programming projects should be completed in small groups (2 to 3 people).
Exceptions to work alone may be granted on request. You must pass both projects to pass the course.
More details on the projects and requirements for passing will be pushed in the coming weeks.

In addition to the programming projects, there is a small written quiz in Week 13. Your final
individual grade (pass/fail) will be determined as a cumulative evaluation of your contributions to
the final programming project and the individual written quiz.
